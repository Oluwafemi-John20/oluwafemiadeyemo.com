**Holla Friend!**

*C'mon, it‚Äôs you! Yes, You!* 

A few weeks into the year 2025, how is it going? Has any goal been achieved yet?
Most people like myself are falling short of some of the desired habits and plans for the month. As the year started, I planned to read a chapter every day for the year ‚Äì well, I have read 11 chapters this year which is far less than 23 (date of writing). This makes me wonder why consistency is an issue for most individuals. 

A big question comes to mind: Am I inconsistent? Sounds funny rightüòÇ‚Ä¶ I know!

Focusing on this question has given me quite several ways to answer the question, I begin by saying if I am inconsistent, does that mean I maintain a habit of consistent inconsistency? Maybe one can maintain consistency in taking the easy way out leading to inconsistency which in turn delays the achievement of set goals.

Forming a habit is difficult at the initial stages but once this habit is established maintaining consistency is easier, how do I plan to redirect my consistency away from inconsistencies but towards habits that help achieve set goals?

1.	My Calendar / Alarm clock is my personal assistant: I have wondered what the phone of a person who maximizes the usage of his mobile device would look like. Treating your phone as a virtual personal assistant to keep track of actions you have decided to take at a certain time would aid accountability lacking for most individuals. Hearing people say that 24 hours isn‚Äôt enough because of the activities they undertake each day has made me look at their schedules and time management strategies, often time it is poor time management strategies. Setting a time limit for applications and alarms for tasks is a great way to build consistency.

2.	Start with a comfortable period for the activity: To build consistency, you must ease yourself into the system. A common trap we all fall victim to is caused by sudden motivation and lack of a system. I remember watching a very inspiring gym video on YouTube and I decided to do 30 pushups per day, before this I hadn‚Äôt done pushups in years. I was able to do 20 pushups for 2 days then I stopped. Months later when I decided to do 10 pushups after every meal, I was able to stay consistent in hitting the set goal without a lot of pressure of getting exhausted. A good system helps maintain the discipline needed to hit the goal!

3.	Be prompt: Once you remember you are to do a certain task, do it immediately. The longer you stay without doing it, the more reason you‚Äôll find to procrastinate and a repeated pattern of this makes you forget the goal. Practice being an active person who does this in the instance, helps to get things done.

As the rest of the year unfolds, the set goals are achievable if we just stay consistent with habits that would drive the fulfilment of our dreams across all spheres of life.  I would take this weekend to customize my virtual assistant (my phone) and make sure I am a step closer each day. I hope you do the same because I‚Äôll ask you next time! A friend posted ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt lock-in in 2025, I will be in problem‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want you to be in a problem, so lock in consistently!
