I am a solution-minded data scientist with a solid understanding of end-to-end data science best practices and love to crunch data and analyze both spatial and non-spatial data for actionable insights.  I am proficient in the use of Python, SQL, PowerBI, Microsoft Excel, Safe FME, ArcGIS, and QGIS among others. Looking for opportunities to learn and build a career by working with organizations leveraging advanced technology  and innovation that impact lives positively across a wide range of industries.

**Work Experience**

**Data/Intelligence Analyst - Towntalk Solutions**

 Process Optimization
 * Spearheaded the optimization of information gathering processes, streamlining data 
 acquisition from diverse sources.
 * Developed and implemented automated data pipelines, reducing manual efforts and 
 improving data accuracy.
 * Employed advanced data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, ensuring high-quality 
 inputs for analytical models.

 Dashboard Development:
 * Pioneered the design and construction of insightful dashboards tailored to meet the 
 specific needs of stakeholders.
 * Utilized cutting-edge data visualization tools, such as python and Power BI, to transform 
 complex datasets into intuitive and actionable insights.
 * Collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) 
 and integrated them into interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring.

**GIS Intern -  National Space Research and Development Agency**

 * As a GIS Intern at NASRDA, under the Natural Resource Management Department, I
 gained hands-on experience in various geospatial projects that intersected with
 agriculture and environmental management. My internship provided me with a solid
 foundation in drone technology, where I was trained in drone operations and flight path
 planning, crucial skills for capturing high-resolution spatial data.
 * During the internship, I actively participated in the detection and classification of
 Cassava and Cocoa crops using Roboflow and Python. This project involved training
 machine learning models to accurately identify and classify crop types from aerial
 imagery, which was essential for monitoring crop health and optimizing agricultural
 practices.
 * Furthermore, I was involved in biomass estimation for yield prediction at the NASRDA
 Research Farm. This project aimed to forecast crop yields, particularly for maize, by
 analyzing biomass data. My contribution to this project helped in developing predictive
 models that are vital for improving agricultural productivity and ensuring food security.


**Associate Data Scientist - Techaxle Inc**

* Built Machine Learning models for classification of user behaviours using Clustering
 technique
* Developed end-to-end data analysis including assembling data sources using SQL,
 analytics using Python, and dashboarding with Tableau and PowerBI.
* Worked closely with client management to prioritize reporting needs, provided analysis
 and deep insights around critical indicators of the company performance, like volume,
 gross profit, and cost efficiency.
* Performed analysis to identify unique and most profitable sales areas, and pinpointâ€™s
 new locations for growth potential.
* Applied nominatim and google maps API to geocode addresses to perform spatial
 analysis that enabled the client mapped the sales to a location on the map.
